# BUILDING A SECURE HEALTHCARE ACCESS PLATFORM

The objective is to develop a secure and user-controlled platform for accessing healthcare
details, empowering patients to control their healthcare information while ensuring privacy,
security, and seamless interaction with healthcare providers. The platform aims to leverage
blockchain technology, smart contracts, and decentralized storage to facilitate secure data
exchange and streamline healthcare processes. Patients should be able to manage and update
their healthcare data, and hospitals should be able to access and update the data if required,
with the patient’s consent

KEY FEATURES
● Implement a private blockchain network having two entities, patients who store their data
in the blockchain and hospitals who can access the data ensuring data integrity and
confidentiality.
● Establish mechanisms for temporary access authorization, allowing doctors and
hospitals to access patient records during appointment hours while respecting patient
privacy and consent. They should be able to update the data during this time.
● Integrate secured decentralized storage solutions to store patient data securely while
maintaining accessibility and redundancy.
● Develop methods to verify patient and hospital identities, enabling secure entry into the
private blockchain network and facilitating appointment scheduling, record updates, and
data submission.
● Show the version history of the patient data to show how many times the data got
changed, who changed it, and what changes were made.

BROWNIE POINTS
● Design a user-friendly interface that displays statistics and all user information. Include
a section to show all appointments and other necessary details on the hospital side.
● Implement statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms within the user interface
to provide insights into trends in a patient’s health and records, therefore aiding them in
decision-making.
